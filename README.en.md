Examiner project

Examiner project is written in Python 3 programming language, uses PyQt5 as the graphics library and sqlite for working with a database. Please ensure that all python components are installed before running.

Examiner consists of 3 modules: student, teacher and server; and is intended for passing exams online.

The student module is required for a student who wants to pass an exam.
The teacher module is required for a teacher who can create, view and edit the exams.
The server module - must be run separately to let student and teacher modules work.
